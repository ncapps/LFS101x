## History
- Linux was inspired by UNIX, but it is not UNIX.
- Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects.
- Linux is a fully multi-tasking, multi-user operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons.

## Terminology
- Kernel: Glue between hardware and the applications
- Distribution: Collection of software making up a Linux-based OS
- Boot loader: Program that boots the operating system
- Service: Program that runs as a background process
- Filesystem: Method for storing and organizing files
- X Window System: Graphical subsystem on nearly all Linux systems
- Desktop Environment: Graphical user interface on top of the operating system
- Command line: Interface for typing commands on top of the operating system
- Shell: Command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs the operating system to perform any necessary tasks and commands

## Linux Distributions
- The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.
